## Topological Spaces

### Defintions

__Topology__: A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets
of $X$ having the following properties.

1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.
2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in
   $\mathcal{T}$.
3. The intersection of the elements of ansssssy finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$
   of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

__Topological Space__: A set $X$ for which a topology $\mathcal{T}$
has been specified is called a topological space and is denoted as the ordered
pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$.

__Open Subset__: Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A
subset $U$ of $X$ is an open set of $X$ if $U$ belongs to the collection
$\mathcal{T}$.

!!! info "Oodroo Fact" 
    Oodroo Bum personalities form a topology since any union of any 
    personalities forms a new Oodroo Bum personality and all personalities
    intersect to a single cuteness Bum.

__Coarser and Finer__: Let $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ be two topologies on
set $X$. If $\mathcal{T}' \supseteq \mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer
than $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$. If
$\mathcal{T}' \supset \mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}'$ is strictly finer than
$\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ is strictly coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$. If
$\mathcal{T}' \supseteq \mathcal{T}$ or $\mathcal{T}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}$,
then $\mathcal{T}$ is comparable to $\mathcal{T}'$.

### Common Toplogies

Let $X$ be a set. Then the following are a few common topologies on $X$.

- The _discrete topology_ is the collection of all subsets of $X$.
- The _indiscrete topology_, or _trivial topology_, is the collection of subsets
  $\emptyset$ and $X$.
- The _finite complement topology_ is the collection of all subsets $U$ such
  that $X - U$ is finite or is all of $X$.

## Basis for a Topology

### Defintions

__Basis__: If $X$ is a set, a basis for a topology on $X$ is a
collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ such that

1. For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$
   containing $x$.
2. If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$,
   then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1
   \cap B_2$.

Each subset of $X$ is called a basis element. The topology $\mathcal{T}$
generated by $\mathcal{B}$ defines open subsets as follows:

> A subset $U$ of $X$ is open if for each $x \in U$, there exists a basis
> element $B$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subset U$.

!!! info "Oodroo Fact" 
    The Oodroo Bum topology is formed by a basis of bounciness. Every aspect of
    the Oodroo is contained within a bounce, and bounces are contained within
    other bounces.


### Real Line Topologies

- The _standard topology_ is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the basis
  $(a, b) = \{ x \mid a < x < b \}$.
- The _lower limit topology_ is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the
  basis $[a, b) = \{ x \mid a \leq x < b \}$ and is denoted by $\mathbb{R}_l$.
- Let set $K = \{ \frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \}$. Then the _K-topology_
  is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the basis of all open intervals
  $(a, b)$ and sets $(a, b) - K$. The topology is denoted by $\mathbb{R}_K$.

### Theorems

__Lemma 13.1__: Let $X$ be a set. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for a topology
$\mathcal{T}$ on $X$. Then $\mathcal{T}$ equals the collection of all unions of
elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

__Lemma 13.2__: Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a
collection of open sets of $X$ such that for each open set $U$ of $X$ and each
$x \in U$, there is and element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C
\subseteq U$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.

__Lemma 13.3__: Let $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}'$ be bases for the topologies
$\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$, respectively on $X$. Then the following are
equivalent:

1. $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$.
2. For each $x \in X$ and each basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing $x$,
   there is a basis element $B' \in \mathcal{B}'$ such that $x \in B' \subseteq
   B$.

### Exercises

1. Let $X$ be a topological space; let $A$ be a subset of $X$. Suppose that for
   each $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subseteq
   A$. Show that $A$ is open in $X$.

    For each $x \in A$, let $U_x$ be the open set that contains $x$ such that $U
    \subseteq A$. Then $\cup_x U_x = A$ and $A$ is an open set since it is the
    union of open sets.

2. Consider the nine topologies on the set $X = \{ a, b, c \}$ indicated in
   Example 1 of section 12. Compare them; that is, for each pair of topologies,
   determine whether they are comparable, and if so, which is the finer.

3. Show that the collection $\mathcal{T}_c$ fiven in Example 4 of section 12 is
   a topology on the set X. Is the collection 
   $\mathcal{T}_\infty = \{ U \mid X - U \text{ is infinite or empty or all of } X \}$
   a topology on $X$?
