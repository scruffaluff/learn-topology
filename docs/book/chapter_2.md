# Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions

## Topological Spaces

A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having
the following properties.

1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.
2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in
   $\mathcal{T}$.
3. The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$
   of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

A set $X$ for which a topology $\mathcal{T}$ has been specified is called a
**topological space** and is denoted as the ordered pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$.

Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A Subset $U$ of $X$ is an open
set of $X$ if $U$ belongs to the collection $\mathcal{T}$.

!!! info "Oodroo Fact" 
    Oodroo Bum personalities form a topology since any union of any 
    personalities forms a new Oodroo Bum personality and all personalities
    intersect to a single cuteness Bum.

Let $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ be two topologies on set $X$. If
$\mathcal{T}' \supseteq \mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer than
$\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$. If $\mathcal{T}'
\supset \mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}'$ is strictly finer than $\mathcal{T}$
and $\mathcal{T}$ is strictly coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$. If $\mathcal{T}'
\supseteq \mathcal{T}$ or $\mathcal{T}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}$, then
$\mathcal{T}$ is comparable to $\mathcal{T}'$.

### Common Toplogies

Let $X$ be a set. Then the following are a few common topologies on $X$.

- The _discrete topology_ is the collection of all subsets of $X$.
- The _indiscrete topology_, or _trivial topology_, is the collection of subsets
  $\emptyset$ and $X$.
- The _finite complement topology_ is the collection of all subsets $U$ such
  that $X - U$ is finite or is all of $X$.

## Basis for a Topology

If $X$ is a set, a basis for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of
subsets of $X$ such that

1. For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$
   containing $x$.
2. If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$,
   then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1
   \cap B_2$.

Each subset of $X$ is called a basis element. The topology $\mathcal{T}$
generated by $\mathcal{B}$ defines open subsets as follows:

> A subset $U$ of $X$ is open if for each $x \in U$, there exists a basis
> element $B$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subset U$.

!!! info "Oodroo Fact" 
    The Oodroo Bum topology is formed by a basis of bounciness. Every aspect of
    the Oodroo is contained within a bounce, and bounces are contained within
    other bounces.

### Exercises

1. Let $X$ be a topological space; let $A$ be a subset of $X$. Suppose that for
each $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that
$U \subset
    A$. Show that $A$ is open in $X$.

    Then $X$ the

2. Consider the nine topologies on the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$ indicated in
Example 1 of section 12. Compare them; that is, for each pair of topologies,
determine whether they are comparable, and if so, which is the finer.

3. Show that the collection $\mathcal{T}_c$ fiven in Example 4 of section 12 is
a topology on the set X. Is the collection
$$ 
    \mathcal{T}_{\infty} = \{ U \mid X - U \text{ is infinite or empty of all of } X \}
    $$
a topology on $X$?
