## Topological Spaces

### Defintions

__Topology__: A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets
of $X$ having the following properties.

1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.
2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in
   $\mathcal{T}$.
3. The intersection of the elements of ansssssy finite subcollection of
   $\mathcal{T}$ of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

__Topological Space__: A set $X$ for which a topology $\mathcal{T}$
has been specified is called a topological space and is denoted as the ordered
pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$.

__Open Subset__: Let $(X, \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. A
subset $U$ of $X$ is an open set of $X$ if $U$ belongs to the collection
$\mathcal{T}$.

!!! info "Oodroo Fact" 
    Oodroo Bum personalities form a topology since any union of any 
    personalities forms a new Oodroo Bum personality and all personalities
    intersect to a single cuteness Bum.

__Coarser and Finer__: Let $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ be two topologies on
set $X$. If $\mathcal{T}' \supseteq \mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer
than $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ is coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$. If
$\mathcal{T}' \supset \mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{T}'$ is strictly finer than
$\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ is strictly coarser than $\mathcal{T}'$. If
$\mathcal{T}' \supseteq \mathcal{T}$ or $\mathcal{T}' \subseteq \mathcal{T}$,
then $\mathcal{T}$ is comparable to $\mathcal{T}'$.

### Common Toplogies

Let $X$ be a set. Then the following are a few common topologies on $X$.

- The _discrete topology_ is the collection of all subsets of $X$.
- The _indiscrete topology_, or _trivial topology_, is the collection of subsets
  $\emptyset$ and $X$.
- The _finite complement topology_ is the collection of all subsets $U$ such
  that $X - U$ is finite or is all of $X$.

## Basis for a Topology

### Defintions

__Basis__: If $X$ is a set, a basis for a topology on $X$ is a
collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ such that

1. For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$
   containing $x$.
2. If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$,
   then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subset B_1
   \cap B_2$.

Each subset of $X$ is called a basis element. The topology $\mathcal{T}$
generated by $\mathcal{B}$ defines open subsets as follows:

> A subset $U$ of $X$ is open if for each $x \in U$, there exists a basis
> element $B$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subset U$.

__Subbasis__: A subbasis $\mathcal{S}$ for a topology on $X$ is a collection of
subsets of $X$ whose union equals $X$. The topology generated by the subbasis
$\mathcal{S}$ is defined to be the collection $\mathcal{T}$ of all unions of
finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$.

!!! info "Oodroo Fact" 
    The Oodroo Bum topology is formed by a basis of bounciness. Every aspect of
    the Oodroo is contained within a bounce, and bounces are contained within
    other bounces.


### Real Line Topologies

- The _standard topology_ is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the basis
  $(a, b) = \{ x \mid a < x < b \}$.
- The _lower limit topology_ is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the
  basis $[a, b) = \{ x \mid a \leq x < b \}$ and is denoted by $\mathbb{R}_l$.
- Let set $K = \{ \frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \}$. Then the _K-topology_
  is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the basis of all open intervals
  $(a, b)$ and sets $(a, b) - K$. The topology is denoted by $\mathbb{R}_K$.

The topologies $\mathbb{R}_l$ and $\mathbb{R}_K$ are not comparable. Note that
open set $[0, 1) \in \mathbb{R}_l$, but  $[0, 1) \notin \mathbb{R}_K$.

### Theorems

__Lemma 13.1__: Let $X$ be a set. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for a topology
$\mathcal{T}$ on $X$. Then $\mathcal{T}$ equals the collection of all unions of
elements of $\mathcal{B}$.

__Lemma 13.2__: Let $X$ be a topological space. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a
collection of open sets of $X$ such that for each open set $U$ of $X$ and each
$x \in U$, there is and element $C$ of $\mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C
\subseteq U$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.

__Lemma 13.3__: Let $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}'$ be bases for the topologies
$\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$, respectively on $X$. Then the following are
equivalent:

1. $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$.
2. For each $x \in X$ and each basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing $x$,
   there is a basis element $B' \in \mathcal{B}'$ such that $x \in B' \subseteq
   B$.

__Lemma 13.4__: The topologies of $\mathbb{R}_l$ and $\mathbb{R}_K$ are strictly
finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, but are not comparable with
one another.

### Exercises

!!! example "Exercise 1"
    Let $X$ be a topological space; let $A$ be a subset of $X$. Suppose that for
    each $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U 
    \subseteq A$. Show that $A$ is open in $X$.

For each $x \in A$, let $U_x$ be the open set that contains $x$ such that $U_x
\subseteq A$. Then $\cup_{ x \in A } U_x = A$ and $A$ is an open set since it is
the union of open sets.

!!! example "Exercise 2"
    Consider the nine topologies on the set $X = \{ a, b, c \}$ indicated in
    Example 1 of section 12. Compare them; that is, for each pair of topologies,
    determine whether they are comparable, and if so, which is the finer.

!!! example "Exercise 3"
    Show that the collection $\mathcal{T}_c$ fiven in Example 4 of section 12 is
    a topology on the set X. Is the collection $\mathcal{T}_\infty = \{ U \mid X
    - U \text{ is infinite or empty or all of } X \}$ a topology on $X$?

Let $X$ be a set. Let $\mathcal{T}_C$ be the collection of all subsets $U$ of
$X$ such $X - U$ is countable or is all of $X$. Let $U_c$ be a collection of
nonempty sets from $\mathcal{T}_C$. Thus each set $X - U_c$ is countable.

1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}_C$ since $X - \emptyset = X$ and
   $X - X = \emptyset$, which is countable.
2. By [De Morgan's set difference union
   law](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_Laws_(Set_Theory)/Set_Difference/Family_of_Sets/Difference_with_Union),
   $X - \cup_c U_c = \cap (X - U_c)$. Since the intersection of a collection of
   countable sets is countable, $\mathcal{T}_C$ is closed under set union.
3. By [De Morgan's set difference intersection
   law](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_Laws_(Set_Theory)/Set_Difference/Family_of_Sets/Difference_with_Intersection),
   $X - \cap_c U_c = \cup (X - U_c)$. Since the [finite union of countable sets
   is
   countable](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Countable_Union_of_Countable_Sets_is_Countable/Proof_1),
   $\mathcal{T}_C$ is closed under finite set intersection.
  
Therefore $\mathcal{T}_C$ is a topology.

!!! example "Exercise 4"
    (a) If $\{ \mathcal{T}_\alpha \}$ is a family of topologies on $X$, show that
        $\cap \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is a topology on $X$. Is $\cup 
        \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ a topology on $X$?<br>
    (b) Let $\{ \mathcal{T}_\alpha \}$ be a family of topologies on $X$. Show 
        that there is a unique smallest topology on $X$ containing all the 
        collections $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$, and unique largest topology conatined
        in all $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$.<br>
    \(c) If $X = \{ a, b, c \}$, let<br>
        $$ \mathcal{T}_1 = \\{ \emptyset, X, \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \\} \text{ and }
        \mathcal{T}_2 = \\{ \emptyset, X, \{ a \}, \{ b, c \} \\} $$
        Find the smallest topology containing $\mathcal{T}_1$ and
        $\mathcal{T}_2$, and the largest topology contained in $\mathcal{T}_1$
        and $\mathcal{T}_2$.

!!! example "Exercise 5"
    Show that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a basis for a topology on
    $X$, then the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$ equals the intersection of
    all topologies on $X$ that contain $\mathcal{A}$. Prove the same if
    $\mathcal{A}$ is a subbasis.

Let $\{ \mathcal{T}_c \}_{c \in C}$ be the collection of all topologies such
that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_c$ for each topology $\mathcal{T}_c$.
Let $T_{\mathcal{A} }$ be the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$.

$T_{\mathcal{A} }$ is topology that contains $\mathcal{A}$ and thus is in
$\{\mathcal{T}_c \}_{c \in C}$. As a result $\cap_{c \in C} \mathcal{T}_c$ is a
subset of $T_{\mathcal{A} }$.

Every topology from $\{ \mathcal{T}_c \}_{c \in C}$ contains $\mathcal{A}$ and
topologies are closed under set union. Thus the collection of all set unions
from $\mathcal{A}$ must be a subset of every topology from $\{ \mathcal{T}_c
\}_{c \in C}$. By Lemma 13.1, $T_{ \mathcal{A} }$ is a subset of $\cap_{c \in C}
\mathcal{T}_c$.

Therefore, $T_{ \mathcal{A} } = \cap_{c \in C} \mathcal{T}_c$.

!!! example "Exercise 6" 
    Show that the topologies of $\mathbb{R}_l$ and$\mathbb{R}_K$ are not
    comparable.

!!! example "Exercise 7"
    Consider the following topologies on $\mathbb{R}$,<br>
    &emsp; $\mathcal{T}_1 = \text{  the standard topology }$,<br>
    &emsp; $\mathcal{T}_2 = \text{ the topology of } \mathbb{R}_K$,<br>
    &emsp; $\mathcal{T}_3 = \text{ the finite complement topology, }$,<br>
    &emsp; $\mathcal{T}_4 = \text{ the upper limit topology, having all sets }
    (a, b] \text{ as basis }$,<br>
    &emsp; $\mathcal{T}_5 = \text { the topology having all sets } (-\infty, a)
    = \{ x \mid x < a \} \text { as basis }$,<br>
    Determine, for each of these topologies, which of the others it contains.

Since each topology is on $\mathbb{R}$, by lemma 13.1 any topology
$\mathcal{T}_x \subseteq \mathcal{T}_y$ if for any basis element $Y \in
\mathcal{T}_y, Y \in \mathcal{T}_x$. Since the exercise requires several proofs,
each proof will be split into its own section.

* $\mathcal{T}_5 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_1 \wedge \mathcal{T}_1 \not\subseteq
  \mathcal{T}_5$

    Let set $(\infty, a)$ be any basis element from $\mathcal{T}_5$. Then
    $\cup_{ x < a } (x, a) = (-\infty, a)$, and as follows every basis element
    from $\mathcal{T}_5$ is in $\mathcal{T}_1$. Thus $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq
    \mathcal{T}_5$. 
    
    Consider the open set (0, 1) from $\mathcal{T}_1$. Let $X \subseteq
    \mathbb{R}$ and note that $\cap_{x \in \mathbb{R} } (-\infty, x) = (-\infty,
    \inf(X))$ if $\inf(X)$ exists else $\emptyset$. Similarly, $\cup_{x \in
    \mathbb{R} } (-\infty, x) = (-\infty, \sup(X))$ if $\sup(X)$ exists else
    $\mathbb{R}$. As follows, open sets from $\mathcal{T}_5$ can only be of the
    form $(-\infty, x)$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Thus $(0, 1)$ does not belong to
    $\mathcal{T}_5$ and $\mathcal{T}_5 \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_1$.

* $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2 \wedge \mathcal{T}_2 \not\subseteq
  \mathcal{T}_1$

    By definition, $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$.
    
    Let set $K = \{\frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \}$ and as follows
    $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0$. As follows any interval $(a,
    b)$, where $a < 0 < b$, contains elements from $K$. Since the union and
    intersection of open intervals on $\mathbb{R}$ must be equal to the union of
    disjoint open intervals, any set from $\mathcal{T}_1$ which contains 0 must
    be an open interval around 0. As follows, every set from $\mathcal{T}_1$
    containing 0, must also contain an element from $K$. Thus $(-1, 1) -K$ does
    not belong to $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2 \not\subseteq
    \mathcal{T}_1$.

* $\mathcal{T}_3 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_1 \wedge \mathcal{T}_1 \not\subseteq
  \mathcal{T}_3$

    By definition, $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are in each topology. So let set
    $X$ be any open set in $\mathcal{T}_3$ that is neither $\emptyset$ or
    $\mathbb{R}$. Then set $U = \mathbb{R} - X$ must be finite. Note that
    $\cap_{u \in U} [(-\infty, u) \cup (u, \infty)] = X$ which is in
    $\mathcal{T}_1$ since topologies are closed under finite intersection and
    union. Thus $\mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_3$.

    Consider open set $(0, 1)$ from $\mathcal{T}_1$. Since $\mathbb{R} - (0, 1)$
    is not finite, it does not belong to $\mathcal{T}_3$. Thus $\mathcal{T}_1
    \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_3$.

* $\mathcal{T}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_4 \wedge \mathcal{T}_4 \not\subseteq
  \mathcal{T}_2$

    Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and note that the set $\cup_{ \{ x \mid a < x < b
    \} } (a, x] = (a, b)$ is in $\mathcal{T}_4$ since topologies are closed
    under arbitrary union. Let set $K = \{\frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_+
    \}$ and let set $\mathcal{K} = \cup_{ k \in \mathbb{Z}_+ } (\frac{1}{k + 1},
    \frac{1}{k})$. Then $\mathcal{K}$ contains no points from $K$ and $(a, b) -
    K = (a, 0] \cup \mathcal{K} \cap (0, b)$. Thus $\mathcal{T}_2 \subseteq
    \mathcal{T}_4$.

    Consider open set $(2, 3]$ from $\mathcal{T}_4$. Since the arbitrary union
    and finite intersection of intervals from $\mathbb{R}$ is equal to [the
    union of disjoint open
    intervals](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Open_Sets_in_Real_Number_Line) and
    $(2, 3]$ is not open in the standard topology, $(2, 3]$ cannot be in
    $\mathcal{T}_2$. Thus $\mathcal{T}_4 \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_2$.

* $\mathcal{T}_3 \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_5 \wedge \mathcal{T}_5 \not\subseteq
  \mathcal{T}_3$

    Consider open set $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$ from $\mathcal{T}_3$. From
    the $\mathcal{T}_1 \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_5$ proof, $\mathcal{T}_5$
    cannot contain the set $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$. Thus $\mathcal{T}_3
    \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_5$.

    Consider open set $(-\infty, 0)$ from $\mathcal{T}_5$. Since $\mathbb{R} -
    (-\infty, 0)$ is not finite, it does not belong to $\mathcal{T}_3$. Thus
    $\mathcal{T}_5 \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_3$.

Therefore the finer relationships between the topologies are

$$
    \mathcal{T}_ 5 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2 \subseteq 
    \mathcal{T}_4 \\
    \mathcal{T}_ 3 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{T}_2 \subseteq 
    \mathcal{T}_4 \\
    \mathcal{T}_ 3 \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_ 5 \wedge \mathcal{T}_ 5 
    \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}_ 3
$$


!!! example "Exercise 8"
    (a) Apply Lemma 13.2 to show that the countable collection
        $$ \mathcal{B} = \\{ (a, b) \mid a < b, a \text{ and } b 
        \text{ rational } \\} $$
        is a basis that generates the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
    (b) Show the collection
        $$ \mathcal{C} = \\{ [a, b) \mid a < b, a \text{ and } b 
        \text{ rational } \\} $$
        is a basis that generates a topology different from the lower limit
        topology on $\mathbb{R}$.

## The Order Topology

### Definitions

__Order Topology__: Let $X$ be a set with a simple order relation; assume $X$
has more thatn one element. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of all sets of
the following types:

1.  All open intervals $(a, b)$ in $X$.
2.  All intervals of the form $[a_0, b)$, where $a_0$ is the smallest element
    (if any) of $X$.
3. All intervals of the form $(a, b_0]$, where $b_0$ is the largest element (if
   any) of $X$.

The collection $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, which is called
the order topology.

__Ray__: If $X$ is an ordered set, and $a$ is an element of $X$, there are four
subsets of $X$ that are called the rays determined by $a$. They are the
following:

$$
(a, +\infty) = \{ x \mid x > a \} \\
(-\infty, a) = \{ x \mid x < a \} \\
[a, +\infty) = \{ x \mid x \geq a \} \\
(-\infty, a] = \{ x \mid x \leq a \}
$$

Sets of the first two types are called open rays, and sets of the last two types
are called closed rays.

## The Product Topology on $X \times Y$

### Definitions

__Product Topology__: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. The product
topology on $X \times Y$ is the topology having as basis the collection
$\mathcal{B}$ of all sets of the form $U \times V$, where $U$ is an open subset
of $X$ and $V$ is an open subset of $Y$.

__Projection__: Let $\pi_1: X \times Y \rightarrow X$ be defined by the equation

$$ \pi_1(x, y) = x $$

Let $\pi_2: X \times Y \rightarrow Y$ be defined by the equation

$$ \pi_2(x, y) = y $$

The maps $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are called projections of $X \times Y$ onto its
first and second factors, respectively.

### Theorems

__Theorem 15.1__: If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$ and
$\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $Y$, then the collection

$$ \mathcal{D} = \{ B \times C \mid B \in \mathcal{B} \text{ and } C \in
\mathcal{C} \} $$

is a basis for the topology of $X \times Y$.

__Theorem 15.2__: The collection

$$ S = \{ \pi_1^{-1}(U) \mid U \text{ open in } X \} \cup \{ \pi_2^{-1}(V) \mid
V \text{ open in } Y \} $$

is a subbasis for the product topology on $X \times Y$.

---

## The Subspace Topology

### Definitions

__Subspace Topology__: Let $X$ be a topological space with topology
$\mathcal{T}$. If $Y$ is a subset of $X$, the collection

$$ \mathcal{T}_Y = \{ Y \cap U \mid U \in \mathcal{T} \} $$

is a topology on $Y$, called the subspace topology and $Y$ is called a subspace
of $X$.

__Convex__: Let $X$ be an ordered set. A subset $Y$ of $X$ is convex in $X$ if
for each pair of points $a < b$ of $Y$, the entire interval $(a, b)$ of points
of $X$ lies in $Y$.

### Theorems

__Lemma 16.1__: If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$ then the
collection 

$$ \mathcal{B}_Y = \{ B \cap Y \mid B \in \mathcal{B} \} $$ 

is a basis for the subspace topology on Y.

__Lemma 16.2__: Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is
open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

__Theorem 16.3__: If $A$ is a subspace of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$, then
the product topology on $A \times B$ is the same as the topology $A \times B$
inherits a a subspace of $X \times Y$.

__Theorem 16.4__: Let $X$ be an ordered set in the order topology. Let $Y$ be a
subset of $X$ that is convex in $X$. Then the order topology on $Y$ is the same
as the topology $Y$ inherits as a subspace of $X$.

### Exercises

!!! example "Exercise 1"

    topology. Compare this topology with the standard topology on
    $\mathbb{R}^2$.
