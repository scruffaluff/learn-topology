#  Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions

## Topological Spaces

A topology on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ 
having the following properties.

1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.
2. The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in 
   $\mathcal{T}$.
4. The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of 
   $\mathcal{T}$ of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.

A set $X$ for which a topology $\mathcal{T}$ has been specified is called a
__topological space__ and is denoted as the ordered pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$.

Let $(X \mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. Subset $U$ of $X$ is an open set
of $X$ if $U$ belongs to the collection $\mathcal{T}$.

### Common Toplogies

Let $X$ be a set. Then the following are a few common topologies on $X$.

* The _discrete topology_ is the collection of all subsets of $X$.
* The _indiscrete topology_, or _trivial topology_, is the collection of subsets
  $\emptyset$ and $X$.

### Exercises

1.
    Let $X$ be a topological space; let $A$ be a subset of $X$. Suppose that for
    each $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subset
    A$. Show that $A$ is open in $X$.

    Then $X$ the

2.
    Consider the nine topologies on the set $X = \{a, b, c\}$ indicated in 
    Example 1 of section 12. Compare them; that is, for each pair of topologies,
    determine whether they are comparable, and if so, which is the finer.

3.
    Show that the collection $\mathcal{T}_c$ fiven in Example 4 of section 12 is a 
    topology on the set X. Is the collection
    $$ 
    \mathcal{T}_{\infty} = \{ U \mid X - U \text{ is infinite or empty of all of } X \}
    $$
    a topology on $X$?
