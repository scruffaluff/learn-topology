Common Toplogies \u00b6 Let X X be a set. Then the following are a few common topologies on X X . The discrete topology is the collection of all subsets of X X . The indiscrete topology , or trivial topology , is the collection of subsets \\emptyset \\emptyset and X X . The finite complement topology is the collection of all subsets U U such that X - U X - U is finite or is all of X X . Basis for a Topology \u00b6 Defintions \u00b6 Basis : If X X is a set, a basis for a topology on X X is a collection \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} of subsets of X X such that For each x \\in X x \\in X , there is at least one basis element B B containing x x . If x x belongs to the intersection of two basis elements B_1 B_1 and B_2 B_2 , then there is a basis element B_3 B_3 containing x x such that B_3 \\subset B_1 \\cap B_2 B_3 \\subset B_1 \\cap B_2 . Each subset of X X is called a basis element. The topology \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} generated by \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} defines open subsets as follows: A subset U U of X X is open if for each x \\in U x \\in U , there exists a basis element B B such that x \\in B x \\in B and B \\subset U B \\subset U . Subbasis : A subbasis \\mathcal{S} \\mathcal{S} for a topology on X X is a collection of subsets of X X whose union equals X X . The topology generated by the subbasis \\mathcal{S} \\mathcal{S} is defined to be the collection \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} of all unions of finite intersections of elements of \\mathcal{S} \\mathcal{S} . Oodroo Fact The Oodroo Bum topology is formed by a basis of bounciness. Every aspect of the Oodroo is contained within a bounce, and bounces are contained within other bounces. Real Line Topologies \u00b6 The standard topology is the topology on \\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{R} generated by the basis (a, b) = \\{ x \\mid a < x < b \\} (a, b) = \\{ x \\mid a < x < b \\} . The lower limit topology is the topology on \\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{R} generated by the basis [a, b) = \\{ x \\mid a \\leq x < b \\} [a, b) = \\{ x \\mid a \\leq x < b \\} and is denoted by \\mathbb{R}_l \\mathbb{R}_l . Let set K = \\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\} K = \\{ \\frac{1}{n} \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+ \\} . Then the K-topology is the topology on \\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{R} generated by the basis of all open intervals (a, b) (a, b) and sets (a, b) - K (a, b) - K . The topology is denoted by \\mathbb{R}_K \\mathbb{R}_K . The topologies \\mathbb{R}_l \\mathbb{R}_l and \\mathbb{R}_K \\mathbb{R}_K are not comparable. Note that open set [0, 1) \\in \\mathbb{R}_l [0, 1) \\in \\mathbb{R}_l , but [0, 1) \\notin \\mathbb{R}_K [0, 1) \\notin \\mathbb{R}_K . Theorems \u00b6 Lemma 13.1 : Let X X be a set. Let \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} be a basis for a topology \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} on X X . Then \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} equals the collection of all unions of elements of \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} . Lemma 13.2 : Let X X be a topological space. Let \\mathcal{C} \\mathcal{C} be a collection of open sets of X X such that for each open set U U of X X and each x \\in U x \\in U , there is and element C C of \\mathcal{C} \\mathcal{C} such that x \\in C \\subseteq U x \\in C \\subseteq U . Then \\mathcal{C} \\mathcal{C} is a basis for the topology of X X . Lemma 13.3 : Let \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} and \\mathcal{B}' \\mathcal{B}' be bases for the topologies \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} and \\mathcal{T}' \\mathcal{T}' , respectively on X X . Then the following are equivalent: \\mathcal{T}' \\mathcal{T}' is finer than \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} . For each x \\in X x \\in X and each basis element B \\in \\mathcal{B} B \\in \\mathcal{B} containing x x , there is a basis element B' \\in \\mathcal{B}' B' \\in \\mathcal{B}' such that x \\in B' \\subseteq B x \\in B' \\subseteq B . Lemma 13.4 : The topologies of \\mathbb{R}_l \\mathbb{R}_l and \\mathbb{R}_K \\mathbb{R}_K are strictly finer than the standard topology on \\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{R} , but are not comparable with one another. Exercises \u00b6 Let X X be a topological space; let A A be a subset of X X . Suppose that for each x \\in A x \\in A there is an open set U U containing x x such that U \\subseteq A U \\subseteq A . Show that A A is open in X X . For each x \\in A x \\in A , let U_x U_x be the open set that contains x x such that U \\subseteq A U \\subseteq A . Then \\cup_x U_x = A \\cup_x U_x = A and A A is an open set since it is the union of open sets. Consider the nine topologies on the set X = \\{ a, b, c \\} X = \\{ a, b, c \\} indicated in Example 1 of section 12. Compare them; that is, for each pair of topologies, determine whether they are comparable, and if so, which is the finer. Show that the collection \\mathcal{T}_c \\mathcal{T}_c fiven in Example 4 of section 12 is a topology on the set X. Is the collection \\mathcal{T}_\\infty = \\{ U \\mid X - U \\text{ is infinite or empty or all of } X \\} \\mathcal{T}_\\infty = \\{ U \\mid X - U \\text{ is infinite or empty or all of } X \\} a topology on X X ? Let X X be a set. Let \\mathcal{T}_C \\mathcal{T}_C be the collection of all subsets U U of X X such X - U X - U is countable or is all of X X . Then \\emptyset \\emptyset and X X are in \\mathcal{T}_C \\mathcal{T}_C since X - \\emptyset = X X - \\emptyset = X and X - X = \\emptyset X - X = \\emptyset which is countable. Let U_c U_c be a collection of nonempty sets from \\mathcal{T}_C \\mathcal{T}_C . Then X - \\cup_c U_c = \\cap (X - U_c) X - \\cup_c U_c = \\cap (X - U_c) where each X - U_c X - U_c is countable. Since the intersection of a collection of countable sets is countable, \\mathcal{T}_C \\mathcal{T}_C is closed under union. Also X - \\cap_c U_c = \\cup (X - U_c) X - \\cap_c U_c = \\cup (X - U_c) . Since the finite union of countable sets is countable, \\mathcal{T}_C$ is closed under finite intersection. Therefore \\mathcal{T}_C \\mathcal{T}_C is a topology.
