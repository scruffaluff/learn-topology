Common Toplogies \u00b6 Let X X be a set. Then the following are a few common topologies on X X . The discrete topology is the collection of all subsets of X X . The indiscrete topology , or trivial topology , is the collection of subsets \\emptyset \\emptyset and X X . The finite complement topology is the collection of all subsets U U such that X - U X - U is finite or is all of X X . Basis for a Topology \u00b6 Definition Basis : If X X is a set, a basis for a topology on X X is a collection \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} of subsets of X X such that For each x \\in X x \\in X , there is at least one basis element B B containing x x . If x x belongs to the intersection of two basis elements B_1 B_1 and B_2 B_2 , then there is a basis element B_3 B_3 containing x x such that B_3 \\subset B_1 \\cap B_2 B_3 \\subset B_1 \\cap B_2 . Each subset of X X is called a basis element. The topology \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} generated by \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} defines open subsets as follows: A subset U U of X X is open if for each x \\in U x \\in U , there exists a basis element B B such that x \\in B x \\in B and B \\subset U B \\subset U . Oodroo Fact The Oodroo Bum topology is formed by a basis of bounciness. Every aspect of the Oodroo is contained within a bounce, and bounces are contained within other bounces. Lemma 13.1 : Let X X be a set. Let \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} be a basis for a topology \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} on X X . Then \\mathcal{T} \\mathcal{T} equals the collection of all unions of elements of \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{B} . Lemma 13.2 : Let X X be a topological space. Let \\mathcal{C} \\mathcal{C} be a collection of open sets of X X such that for each open set U U of X X and each x \\in U x \\in U , there is and element C C of \\mathcal{C} \\mathcal{C} such that x \\in C \\subseteq U x \\in C \\subseteq U . Then \\mathcal{C} \\mathcal{C} is a basis for the topology of X X . Exercises \u00b6 Let X X be a topological space; let A A be a subset of X X . Suppose that for each x \\in A x \\in A there is an open set U U containing x x such that U \\subseteq A U \\subseteq A . Show that A A is open in X X . For each x \\in A x \\in A , let U_x U_x be the open set that contains x x such that U \\subseteq A U \\subseteq A . Then \\cup_x U_x = A \\cup_x U_x = A and A A is an open set since it is the union of open sets. Consider the nine topologies on the set X = \\{a, b, c\\} X = \\{a, b, c\\} indicated in Example 1 of section 12. Compare them; that is, for each pair of topologies, determine whether they are comparable, and if so, which is the finer. Show that the collection \\mathcal{T}_c \\mathcal{T}_c fiven in Example 4 of section 12 is a topology on the set X. Is the collection $$ \\mathcal{T}_{\\infty} = { U \\mid X - U \\text{ is infinite or empty of all of } X } $$ a topology on X X ?
